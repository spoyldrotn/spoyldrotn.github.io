                <p><b>Summary:</b> Surrounded by lush Hawaiian flora on a gently rising hill that features cascading pools and a large fountain, the Laie Hawaii Temple graces the north shore of Oahu just a half mile from the Pacific Ocean. Travelers along Kamehameha Highway can't miss the striking Hale Laa Boulevard that leads the short distance from the highway to the temple. The exquisite boulevard features a tropical garden on one end and palm trees and decorative lights on the other. Sharing the temple grounds is a highly visited public visitors' center. Down the street is Church-owned Brigham Young University–Hawaii and Hawaii's number-one paid attraction, the Polynesian Cultural Center.

                <p><b>Summary:</b> Italian members met the announcement of the Rome Italy Temple with the animated cheering and enthusiasm you might expect to see in a sports arena during a last-second win, explained President Massimo De Feo, president of the Rome Italy Stake, in an interview. He added that since the temple announcement, the stake is seeing the baptism of full families for the first time. In just the previous five years, the number of stakes in Italy grew from three to six. And temple attendance at the distant Bern Switzerland Temple has been much higher from the Saints in Italy than from any other country in the temple district. In the Conference Center, President Thomas S. Monson's announcement of a temple to be constructed in Rome produced wide smiles and an audible gasp of surprise from the congregation during the Saturday Morning Session of the October 2008 General Conference.
