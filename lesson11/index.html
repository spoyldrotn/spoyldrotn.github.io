    <article><p>Less than two weeks into October and already parts of Idaho are dealing with snow and very low temperatures. 
        According to the National Weather Service, Central Idaho and the Northern Panhandle got some light snowfall on Wednesday, while Eastern Idaho saw anywhere from a light dusting to several inches. Other regions across the state could see record-low temperatures.

        featured by Bill Wojcik, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said a low pressure system from Canada is causing the high winds, low temperatures and snow making an early visit to our region.
        “This is an unusual system we’ve been talking about for a couple of days,” he said. "Eastern Oregon and western Idaho – most locations – are going to record and near-record temperatures.
        “Normally our high temperature for Boise is close to 70 degrees – so upper 60s. Today [Wednesday] we’re only looking for a high of maybe 50,” Wojcik continued. 
        That's about 20 degrees below average for the Treasure Valley at this time of year. 
        The current record low for Boise in October is 26 degrees, which was set back in 1985. Forecasts predict Boise could break that record and hit 25 degrees early Thursday morning. 
        Wednesday's storm that dropped snow in eastern Idaho forced the closure of a portion of Interstate 15 from Dubois to the Montana border. 
        The Idaho Transportation Department says road closures aren't unusual with winter conditions, but crews are prepped and work to keep roads open as much as they can. 
         “During last year’s winter season we maintained a 86 percent mobility," said ITD spokesman Adam Rush. "That means our highways were free of snow and ice 86 percent of the time."
        It's important for drivers to keep in mind while traveling during winter months that just because one part of Idaho has clear weather doesn't mean that's the same everywhere. 
        “So, Idaho – we have a variety of terrain here," Rush said. "One area, maybe the highways are dry, free of snow, free of precipitation and other locations here in Idaho may have an active snowstorm."
