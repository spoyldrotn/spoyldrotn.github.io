                <h3>Festival of Lights</h3>
                    <p>Many hands make light work, as the old saying goes.  That surely applies when it comes to staging The Idaho Festival of Lights.

                        But two men, both of whom have departed this life, were responsible for planting the seed, getting people to see the vision, turning on the lights and moving onward over 20 years ago.  Wayne Bell and Walter Ross both were champions of the Festival, and were driving forces in its creation - with a community willing and ready to pick up the torch and make it happen.  They were co-publishers of the The Preston Citizen for several decades.  But they also both served terms as mayor of Preston, and on various civic committees and endeavors over the years.
                        
                        It was actually the widening of State Street, and resultant removal of all of the light poles that used to don the city's Christmas lights, that spawned the idea for the festival, Bell said.  "They put the highway through, widened the street, took out all of the light poles.  That took out all the Christmas lights that used to go across the street.  There was nothing (remaining)," he said.
                        
                        Armed with about $500 from the Chamber of Commerce, along with some funds from the City of Preston, the new celebration started to take shape, first as an idea and quickly in reality, Bell recalled.  "We have these little holes in the sidewalk of the flags.  I decided we'd get Christmas trees to put in them.  We had a light wire above, hung colored spotlights to shine down on the Christmas trees," he said.
                        
                        As with most things, the festival as it is now, has been developed over the years.    "Good ol' Walter (Ross) started talking the merchants into lighting their buildings.  It was really quite impressive."  Then Bell came up with the idea to add a whole festival to the holiday weekend.  Ross, ever the salesman, continued getting ever-more merchants to agree to light their store for the occasion, while Bell put his energy to enhancing the actual festival.
                        
                        The International Bed Race was the brainchild of former Citizen publisher, Kelly Mickelsen.  He gleaned the idea from Vancouver, B.C.   It has become a long-standing tradition of the festival.
                        
                        The Chamber of Commerce produced the Festival for many years.  After the Chamber of Commerce dissolved in 2008, a collective group of citizens volunteered their time to keep the festival going through the 2012 holiday season.  In 2013, the Preston City Council voted to take the reins and oversee the Festival Committee.  Preston City is now the largest sponsor for the Festival, and maintains a committee of 5 members that meet monthly all year long to plan.  In 2013, the Committee moved the parade and events to only Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.  They hope to continue to add events and parade entries for that single day.
                        
                        Trees along State Street are strung with lights, and businesses help provide power.  This became necessary after the State Highway Department removed all power from the posts along State Street.  Preston City also decorates the City Park with thousands of lights and decorations to be enjoyed all December long.
                        
                        The festival has grown, over the years, thanks to financial and other support from many groups and businesses, and the many volunteers who lend a hand in planning the events.
                        
                        It now draws visitors from all over Idaho, Utah and Wyoming.  Many former residents of Preston still travel back for the Festival.     Source: www.idahofestivaloflights.org</p></article>
